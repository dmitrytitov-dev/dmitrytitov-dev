## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a frontend developer who enjoys turning complex ideas into clean, intuitive interfaces. Over the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve worked on everything from MVPs to large-scale systems, with a focus on building reliable, fast, and maintainable web apps.

Right now Iâ€™m working at Soramitsu, where I develop a blockchain explorer platform. One of the things Iâ€™m most proud of is how we improved user engagement by 30% through thoughtful design and performance tuning â€” including cutting the initial page load time in half. Before that, I spent a few years at JetBrains, contributing to the RustRover IDE. I joined as an intern and eventually became a senior developer. Along the way, I rewrote parts of the name resolution engine, sped up auto-import logic by 10x, and improved macro support in Rust tooling.

### Hereâ€™s what I work with regularly:
* âœ… **Frameworks**: Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Pinia, Vuex, Vue Router
* âœ… **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, SCSS, Rust
* âœ… **Tooling**: Vite, Webpack, SPA, SSR, ESLint, Prettier, Linux, Docker
* âœ… **Testing**: Vitest, Jest, CI/CD, Storybook, Playwright, Cypress
* âœ… **Other**: Git, GitHub, GraphQL, WebSocket, WebRTC, REST API, Agile, English

Iâ€™ve always been drawn to frontend development because itâ€™s where users actually experience a product. Thereâ€™s something deeply satisfying about solving real problems and seeing your work come to life on screen.

I care a lot about writing clean, understandable code, collaborating effectively in a team, and continuously improving the product and the process.
