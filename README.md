## Hi there 👋

I’m a frontend developer who enjoys turning complex ideas into clean, intuitive interfaces. Over the past 5 years, I’ve worked on everything from MVPs to large-scale systems, with a focus on building reliable, fast, and maintainable web apps.

Right now I’m working at Soramitsu, where I develop a blockchain explorer platform. One of the things I’m most proud of is how we improved user engagement by 30% through thoughtful design and performance tuning — including cutting the initial page load time in half. Before that, I spent a few years at JetBrains, contributing to the RustRover IDE. I joined as an intern and eventually became a senior developer. Along the way, I rewrote parts of the name resolution engine, sped up auto-import logic by 10x, and improved macro support in Rust tooling.

### Here’s what I work with regularly:
* ✅ **Frameworks & Libraries**: Vue.js, Vue Router, Pinia, Vuex
* ✅ **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, SCSS, Rust
* ✅ **Build & Tooling**: Vite, Webpack, ESLint, Prettier
* ✅ **Testing & Quality**: Vitest, CI/CD, Storybook, Playwright, Cypress
* ✅ **Other**: REST API, GraphQL, WebSocket, WebRTC, Linux, Docker

I’ve always been drawn to frontend development because it’s where users actually experience a product. There’s something deeply satisfying about solving real problems and seeing your work come to life on screen.

I care a lot about writing clean, understandable code, collaborating effectively in a team, and continuously improving the product and the process.
